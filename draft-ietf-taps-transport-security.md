# Introduction

This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network security protocols, with a focus
on how they interact and integrate with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement
efforts to define and catalog transport services {{RFC8095}} by describing the interfaces required to
add security protocols. It examines Transport Layer Security (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer
Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections with TLS (QUIC + TLS), tcpcrypt, Internet Key Exchange
with Encapsulating Security Protocol (IKEv2 + ESP), SRTP (with DTLS), WireGuard, CurveCP,
and MinimalT. For each protocol, this document provides a brief description, the security features it
provides, and the dependencies it has on the underlying transport. This is followed by defining the
set of transport security features shared by these protocols. Finally, we distill the application and
transport interfaces provided by the transport security protocols.

The protocols discussed in this document represent a superset of functionality and features a TAPS system may
need to support, both internally and externally -- via an API -- for applications {{I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}. Ubiquitous
IETF protocols such as (D)TLS, as well as non-standard protocols such as Google QUIC,
are both included despite overlapping features. As such, this survey is not limited to protocols
developed within the scope or context of the IETF. Outside of this candidate set, protocols
that do not offer new features are omitted. For example, newer protocols such as WireGuard make
unique design choices that have important implications on applications, such as how to
best configure peer public keys and to delegate algorithm selection to the system. In contrast,
protocols such as ALTS {{ALTS}} are omitted since they do not represent features deemed unique.

Also, authentication-only protocols such as TCP-AO {{RFC5925}} and IPsec AH {{RFC4302}} are excluded
from this survey. TCP-AO adds authenticity protections to long-lived TCP connections, e.g., replay
protection  with per-packet Message Authentication Codes. (This protocol obsoletes TCP MD5 "signature"
options specified in {{RFC2385}}.) One prime use case of TCP-AO is for protecting BGP connections.
Similarly, AH adds per-datagram authenticity and adds similar replay protection. Despite these
improvements, neither protocol sees general use and both lack critical properties important for emergent
transport security protocols: confidentiality, privacy protections, and agility. Thus, we omit
these and related protocols from our survey.

# Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the roles and interactions of transport security protocols:

- Transport Feature: a specific end-to-end feature that the transport layer provides to an application.
Examples include confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, message-versus-stream orientation, etc.

- Transport Service: a set of Transport Features, without an association to any given framing protocol,
which provides functionality to an application.

- Transport Protocol: an implementation that provides one or more different transport services using a
specific framing and header format on the wire. A Transport Protocol services an application.

- Application: an entity that uses a transport protocol for end-to-end delivery of data across the network.
This may also be an upper layer protocol or tunnel encapsulation.

- Security Feature: a feature that a network security layer provides to applications. Examples
include authentication, encryption, key generation, session resumption, and privacy. Features may be
Mandatory or Optional for an application's implementation. Security Features extend the set of
Transport Features described in {{!RFC8095}} and provided by Transport Services implementations.

- Security Protocol: a defined network protocol that implements one or more security features. Security
protocols may be used alongside transport protocols, and in combination with other security protocols when
appropriate.

- Handshake Protocol: a protocol that enables peers to validate each other and to securely establish
shared cryptographic context.

- Record: Framed protocol messages.

- Record Protocol: a security protocol that allows data to be divided into manageable blocks and protected
using shared cryptographic context.

- Session: an ephemeral security association between applications.

- Cryptographic context: a set of cryptographic parameters, including but not necessarily limited to keys
for encryption, authentication, and session resumption, enabling authorized parties to a session to communicate securely.

- Connection: the shared state of two or more endpoints that persists across messages that are transmitted
between these endpoints. A connection is a transient participant of a session, and a session generally lasts
between connection instances.

- Peer: an endpoint application party to a session.

- Client: the peer responsible for initiating a session.

- Server: the peer responsible for responding to a session initiation.

# Security Features

In this section, we enumerate Security Features exposed by protocols discussed in the
remainder of this document. Protocol security (and privacy) properties that are unrelated to
the API surface exposed by such protocols, such as client or server identity hiding, are
not listed here as features.

- Forward-secure session key establishment: Cryptographic key establishment with forward secure properties.

- Cryptographic algorithm negotiation: Negotiate support of protocol algorithms, including: encryption,
hash, MAC (PRF), and digital signature algorithms.

- Session caching and management: Manage session state cache used for subsequent connections
aimed towards amortizing connection establishment costs.

- Peer authentication (certificate, raw public key, pre-shared key, or EAP-based): Peer authentication using
select or protocol-specific mechanisms.

- Unilateral responder authentication: Required authentication for the responder of a connection.

- Mutual authentication: Connection establishment wherein both endpoints are authenticated.

- Application authentication delegation: Out-of-band peer authentication performed by
applications outside of the connection establishment.

- Record (channel or datagram) confidentiality and integrity: Encryption and authentication of
application plaintext bytes sent between peers over a channel or in individual datagrams.

- Partial record confidentiality: Encryption of some portion of records.

- Optional record integrity: Optional authentication of certain records.

- Record replay prevention: Protocol detection and defense against record replays, e.g., due
to in-network retransmissions.

- Early data support (starting with TLS 1.3): Transmission of application data prior to connection
(handshake) establishment.

- Connection mobility: a property of a connection that allows it to be multihomed or resilient across network
interface or address changes, e.g., NAT rebindings that occur without an endpoint's knowledge. Mobility allows
cryptographic key material and other state information to be reused in the event of a connection change.

- Application-layer feature negotiation: Securely negotiate application-specific functionality,
including those necessary for connection handling and management, e.g., the TLS parent connection
protocol type via ALPN {{RFC7301}} or desired application identity via SNI {{RFC6066}}.

- Configuration extensions: Add protocol features via extensions or configuration options. TLS
extensions are a primary example of this feature.

- Out-of-order record receipt: Processing of records received out-of-order.

- Source validation (cookie or puzzle based): Peer source validation and DoS mitigation via explicit proof
of origin (cookie) or work mechanisms (puzzles).

- Length-hiding padding: Protocol-driven record padding aimed at hiding plaintext message length
and mitigating amplification attack vectors.

# Transport Security Protocol Descriptions

This section contains descriptions of security protocols currently used to protect data
being sent over a network.

For each protocol, we describe its provided features and dependencies on other protocols.

## TLS

TLS (Transport Layer Security) {{RFC5246}} is a common protocol used to establish a secure session between two endpoints. Communication
over this session "prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery." TLS consists
of a tightly coupled handshake and record protocol. The handshake protocol is used to authenticate peers,
negotiate protocol options, such as cryptographic algorithms, and derive session-specific
keying material. The record protocol is used to marshal (possibly encrypted) data from one
peer to the other. This data may contain handshake messages or raw application data.

### Protocol Description

TLS is the composition of a handshake and record protocol {{I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.
The record protocol is designed to marshal an arbitrary, in-order stream of bytes from one endpoint to the other.
It handles segmenting, compressing (when enabled), and encrypting data into discrete records. When configured
to use an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithm, it also handles nonce
generation and encoding for each record. The record protocol is hidden from the client behind a
bytestream-oriented API.

The handshake protocol serves several purposes, including: peer authentication, protocol option (key exchange
algorithm and ciphersuite) negotiation, and key derivation. Peer authentication may be mutual; however, commonly,
only the server is authenticated. X.509 certificates are commonly used in this authentication step, though
other mechanisms, such as raw public keys {{RFC7250}}, exist. The client is not authenticated unless explicitly
requested by the server.

The handshake protocol is also extensible. It allows for a variety of extensions to be included by either the client
or server. These extensions are used to specify client preferences, e.g., the application-layer protocol to be driven
with the TLS connection {{RFC7301}}, or signals to the server to aid operation, e.g., Server Name Indication
(SNI) {{RFC6066}}. Various extensions also exist to tune the parameters of the record protocol, e.g., the
maximum fragment length {{RFC6066}} and record size limit {{!I-D.ietf-tls-record-limit}}.

Alerts are used to convey errors and other atypical events to the endpoints. There are two classes of alerts: closure
and error alerts. A closure alert is used to signal to the other peer that the sender wishes to terminate the connection.
The sender typically follows a close alert with a TCP FIN segment to close the connection. Error alerts are used to
indicate problems with the handshake or individual records. Most errors are fatal and are followed by connection
termination. However, warning alerts may be handled at the discretion of the implementation.

Once a session is disconnected all session keying material must be destroyed, with
the exception of secrets previously established expressly for purposes of session resumption.
TLS supports stateful and stateless resumption. (Here, "state" refers to bookkeeping on a per-session basis
by the server. It is assumed that the client must always store some state information in order to resume a session.)

### Security Features

- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Cryptographic algorithm negotiation.
- Stateful and stateless cross-connection session resumption.
- Session caching and management.
- Peer authentication (Certificate, raw public key, and pre-shared key).
- Unilateral responder authentication.
- Mutual authentication.
- Application authentication delegation.
- Record (channel) confidentiality and integrity.
- Record replay prevention.
- Application-layer feature negotiation.
- Configuration extensions.
- Early data support (starting with TLS 1.3).
- Optional record-layer padding (starting with TLS 1.3).

### Protocol Dependencies

- TCP for in-order, reliable transport.
- (Optionally) A PKI trust store for certificate validation.

## DTLS

DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) {{RFC6347}} is based on TLS, but differs in that
it is designed to run over UDP instead of TCP. Since UDP does not guarantee datagram
ordering or reliability, DTLS modifies the protocol to make sure it can still provide
the same security guarantees as TLS. DTLS was designed to be as close to TLS as possible,
so this document will assume that all properties from TLS are carried over except where specified.

### Protocol Description

DTLS is modified from TLS to operate with the possibility of packet loss, reordering, and duplication
that may occur when operating over UDP. To enable out-of-order delivery of application data, the
DTLS record protocol itself has no inter-record dependencies. However, as the handshake requires
reliability, each handshake message is assigned an explicit sequence number to enable retransmissions
of lost packets and in-order processing by the receiver. Handshake message loss is remedied by sender
retransmission after a configurable period in which the expected response has not yet been received.

As the DTLS handshake protocol runs atop the record protocol, to account for long handshake messages
that cannot fit within a single record, DTLS supports fragmentation and subsequent reconstruction of
handshake messages across records. The receiver must reassemble records before processing.

DTLS relies on unique UDP 4-tuples to identify connections. Since all application-layer data is encrypted,
demultiplexing over the same 4-tuple requires the use of a connection identifier extension {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}}
to permit identification of the correct connection-specific cryptographic context without the use of trial decryption.
(Note that this extension is only supported in DTLS 1.2 and 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}.)

Since datagrams can be replayed, DTLS provides optional anti-replay detection based on a window
of acceptable sequence numbers {{RFC6347}}.

### Security Features

- Record replay protection.
- Record (datagram) confidentiality and integrity.
- Out-of-order record receipt.
- DoS mitigation (cookie-based).

See also the features from TLS.

### Protocol Dependencies

- DTLS relies on UDP.
- The DTLS record protocol explicitly encodes record lengths, so although it runs over a datagram transport, it does not rely on the transport protocol's framing beyond requiring transport-level reconstruction of datagrams fragmented over packets.
(Note: DTLS 1.3 short header records omit the explicit length field.)
- UDP 4-tuple uniqueness, or the connection identifier extension, for demultiplexing.
- Path MTU discovery.
- For the handshake: Reliable, in-order transport. DTLS provides its own reliability.

## (IETF) QUIC with TLS

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a new standards-track transport protocol that runs over
UDP, loosely based on Google's original proprietary gQUIC protocol {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}.
(See {{section-gquic}} for more details.) The QUIC transport layer itself provides support for data
confidentiality and integrity. This requires keys to be derived with a separate handshake protocol.
A mapping for QUIC over TLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-quic-tls}} has been specified to provide this handshake.

### Protocol Description

As QUIC relies on TLS to secure its transport functions, it creates specific integration points
between its security and transport functions:

- Starting the handshake to generate keys and provide authentication (and providing the transport for the handshake).
- Client address validation.
- Key ready events from TLS to notify the QUIC transport.
- Exporting secrets from TLS to the QUIC transport.

The QUIC transport layer support multiple streams over a single connection. QUIC implements
a record protocol for TLS handshake messages to establish a connection. These messages are
sent in special INITIAL and CRYPTO frames {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}, types of which
are encrypted using different keys. INITIAL frames are encrypted using "fixed" keys derived
from the QUIC version and public packet information (Connection ID). CRYPTO frames are
encrypted using TLS handshake secrets. Once TLS completes, QUIC uses the resultant traffic
secrets to protect the rest of the streams. QUIC supports
0-RTT (early) data using previously negotiated connection secrets. (AF: please confirm the following changes are correct.) Early data is sent
in 0-RTT packets, which may be included in the same datagram as the INITIAL and CRYPTO frames.

### Security Features

- DoS mitigation (cookie-based).

See also the properties of TLS.

### Protocol Dependencies

- QUIC transport relies on UDP.
- QUIC transport relies on TLS 1.3 for key exchange, peer authentication, and shared secret derivation.
- For the handshake: Reliable, in-order transport. QUIC provides its own reliability.

### Variant: Google QUIC {#section-gquic}

Google QUIC (gQUIC) is a UDP-based multiplexed streaming protocol designed and deployed by Google
following experience from deploying SPDY, the proprietary predecessor to HTTP/2.
gQUIC was originally known as "QUIC": this document uses gQUIC to unambiguously distinguish
it from the standards-track IETF QUIC. The proprietary technical forebear of IETF QUIC, gQUIC
was originally designed with tightly-integrated security and application data transport protocols.

## IKEv2 with ESP

IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2) {{RFC7296}} and ESP (IP Encapsulating Security Payload) {{RFC4303}} together form the modern IPsec protocol suite that encrypts
and authenticates IP packets, either for creating tunnels (tunnel-mode) or for direct transport
connections (transport-mode). This suite of protocols separates out the key generation protocol
(IKEv2) from the transport encryption protocol (ESP). Each protocol can be used independently,
but this document considers them together, since that is the most common pattern.

### Protocol descriptions

#### IKEv2

IKEv2 is a control protocol that runs on UDP ports 500 or 4500 and TCP port 4500.
Its primary goal is to generate keys for Security Associations (SAs).
An SA contains shared (cryptographic) information used for establishing other SAs or keying ESP;
See {{ESP}}. IKEv2 first uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to generate keys for the "IKE SA",
which is a set of keys used to encrypt further IKEv2 messages. IKE then performs a phase of
authentication in which both peers present blobs signed by a shared secret or private key that
authenticates the entire IKE exchange and the IKE identities. IKE then derives further sets of
keys on demand, which together with traffic policies are referred to as the "Child SA". These
Child SA keys are used by ESP.

IKEv2 negotiates which protocols are acceptable to each peer for both the IKE and Child SAs using
"Proposals". Each proposal specifies an encryption and authentication algorithm, or an AEAD algorithm,
a Diffie-Hellman group, and (for IKE SAs only) a pseudorandom function algorithm. Each peer may
support multiple proposals, and the most preferred mutually supported proposal is chosen during
the handshake.

The authentication phase of IKEv2 may use Shared Secrets, Certificates, Digital Signatures, or an
EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method. At a minimum, IKEv2 takes two round trips to set
up both an IKE SA and a Child SA. If EAP is used, this exchange may be expanded.

Any SA used by IKEv2 can be rekeyed before expiration, which is usually based either on time or
number of bytes encrypted.

There is an extension to IKEv2 that allows session resumption {{RFC5723}}.

MOBIKE is a Mobility and Multihoming extension to IKEv2 that allows a set of Security Associations
to migrate over different outer IP addresses and interfaces {{RFC4555}}.

When UDP is not available or well-supported on a network, IKEv2 may be encapsulated in TCP {{RFC8229}}.

#### ESP {#ESP}

ESP is a protocol that encrypts and authenticates IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The keys used for both
encryption and authentication can be derived from an IKEv2 exchange. ESP Security Associations come
as pairs, one for each direction between two peers. Each SA is identified by a Security Parameter
Index (SPI), which is marked on each encrypted ESP packet.

ESP packets include the SPI, a sequence number, an optional Initialization Vector (IV), payload
data, padding, a length and next header field, and an Integrity Check Value.

From {{RFC4303}}, "ESP is used to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, connectionless
integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and limited traffic
flow confidentiality."

Since ESP operates on IP packets, it is not directly tied to the transport protocols it encrypts.
This means it requires little or no change from transports in order to provide security.

ESP packets may be sent directly over IP, but where network conditions warrant (e.g., when a NAT
is present or when a firewall blocks such packets) they may be encapsulated in UDP {{RFC3948}} or TCP {{RFC8229}}.

### Security Features

#### IKEv2

- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Cryptographic algorithm negotiation.
- Peer authentication (certificate, raw public key, pre-shared key, and EAP).
- Unilateral responder authentication.
- Mutual authentication.
- Record (datagram) confidentiality and integrity.
- Session resumption.
- Connection mobility.
- DoS mitigation (cookie-based).

#### ESP

- Record confidentiality and integrity.
- Record replay protection.

### Protocol Dependencies

#### IKEv2

- Availability of UDP to negotiate, or implementation support for TCP-encapsulation.
- Some EAP authentication types require accessing a hardware device, such as a SIM
card; or interacting with a user, such as password prompting.

#### ESP

- Since ESP is below transport protocols, it does not have any dependencies on the
transports themselves, other than on UDP or TCP where encapsulation is employed.

## Secure RTP (with DTLS)

Secure RTP (SRTP) is a profile for RTP that provides confidentiality, message
authentication, and replay protection for RTP data packets and RTP control
protocol (RTCP) packets {{RFC3711}}.

### Protocol description

SRTP adds confidentiality and optional integrity protection to RTP data packets,
and adds confidentially and mandatory integrity protection to RTCP packets.
For RTP data packets, this is done by encrypting the payload section of the packet
and optionally appending an authentication tag (MAC) as a packet trailer, with the RTP
header authenticated but not encrypted (the RTP header was left unencrypted
to enable RTP header compression {{RFC2508}} {{RFC3545}}). For RTCP packets, the first packet
in the compound RTCP packet is partially encrypted, leaving the first eight octets of
the header as clear-text to allow identification of the packet as RTCP, while the remainder
of the compound packet is fully encrypted. The entire RTCP packet is then authenticated
by appending a MAC as packet trailer.

Packets are encrypted using session keys, which
are ultimately derived from a master key and an additional master salt and session salt.
SRTP packets carry a 2-byte sequence number to partially identify the unique packet
index. SRTP peers maintain a separate roll-over counter (ROC) for RTP data packets that is
incremented whenever the sequence number wraps. The sequence number and ROC together
determine the packet index. RTCP packets have a similar, yet differently named, field
called the RTCP index which serves the same purpose.

Numerous encryption modes are supported. For popular modes of operation, e.g., AES-CTR,
the (unique) initialization vector (IV) used for each encryption mode is a function of
the RTP SSRC (synchronization source), packet index, and session "salting key".

SRTP offers replay detection by keeping a replay list of already seen and processed packet indices.
If a packet arrives with an index that matches one in the replay list, it is silently discarded.

DTLS {{RFC5764}} is commonly used to perform mutual authentication and key
agreement for SRTP {{RFC5763}}.
Peers use DTLS to perform mutual certificate-based authentication on the
media path, and to generate the SRTP master key.
Peer certificates can be issued and signed by a certificate authority.
Alternatively, certificates used in the DTLS exchange can be self-signed.
If they are self-signed, certificate fingerprints are included in the signalling
exchange (e.g., in SIP or WebRTC), and used to bind the DTLS key exchange in
the media plane to the signaling plane.
The combination of a mutually authenticated DTLS key exchange on the media
path and a fingerprint sent in the signalling channel protects against
active attacks on the media, provided the signalling can be trusted.
Signalling needs to be protected as described in, for example, SIP
{{RFC3261}} Authenticated Identity Management {{RFC4474}} or the WebRTC
security architecture {{I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch}}, to provide
complete system security.

### Security Features

- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Cryptographic algorithm negotiation.
- Mutual authentication.
- Partial datagram confidentiality. (Packet headers are not encrypted.)
- Optional authentication of data packets.
- Mandatory authentication of control packets.
- Out-of-order record receipt.

### Protocol Dependencies

- Secure RTP can run over UDP or TCP.
- External key derivation and management protocol, e.g., DTLS {{RFC5763}}.
- External identity management protocol, e.g., SIP Authenticated Identity Management
  {{RFC4474}}, WebRTC Security Architecture {{I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch}}.

### Variant: ZRTP for Media Path Key Agreement

ZRTP {{RFC6189}} is an alternative key agreement protocol for SRTP.
It uses standard SRTP to protect RTP data packets and RTCP packets, but
provides alternative key agreement and identity management protocols.

Key agreement is performed using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange that runs
on the media path. This generates a shared secret that is then used to
generate the master key and salt for SRTP.

ZRTP does not rely on a PKI or external identity management system.
Rather, it uses an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with hash
commitment to allow detection of man-in-the-middle attacks.
This requires endpoints to display a short authentication string that the
users must read and verbally compare to validate the hashes and ensure security.
Endpoints cache some key material after the first call to use in subsequent
calls; this is mixed in with the Diffie-Hellman shared secret, so the short
authentication string need only be checked once for a given user.  This
gives key continuity properties analogous to the secure shell (ssh)
{{RFC4253}}.

## tcpcrypt

Tcpcrypt is a lightweight extension to the TCP protocol for opportunistic encryption. Applications may
use tcpcrypt's unique session ID for further application-level authentication. Absent this authentication,
tcpcrypt is vulnerable to active attacks.

### Protocol Description

Tcpcrypt extends TCP to enable opportunistic encryption between the two ends of a TCP connection {{I-D.ietf-tcpinc-tcpcrypt}}.
It is a family of TCP encryption protocols (TEP), distinguished by key exchange algorithm.
The use of a TEP is negotiated with a TCP option during the initial TCP handshake via the mechanism
described by TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (ENO) {{I-D.ietf-tcpinc-tcpeno}}.
In the case of initial session establishment, once a tcpcrypt TEP has been negotiated the key exchange
occurs within the data segments of the first few packets exchanged after the handshake completes. The
initiator of a connection sends a list of supported AEAD algorithms, a random nonce, and an ephemeral public key share.
The responder typically chooses a mutually-supported AEAD algorithm and replies with this choice, its own nonce, and ephemeral key share.
An initial shared secret is derived from the ENO handshake, the tcpcrypt handshake, and the initial
keying material resulting from the key exchange. The traffic encryption keys on the initial connection
are derived from the shared secret. Connections can be re-keyed before the natural AEAD limit for a single
set of traffic encryption keys is reached.

Each tcpcrypt session is associated with a ladder of resumption IDs, each derived from the respective
entry in a ladder of shared secrets. These resumption IDs can be used to negotiate a stateful resumption
of the session in a subsequent connection, resulting in use of a new shared secret and traffic encryption
keys without requiring a new key exchange. Willingness to resume a session is signaled via the ENO option
during the TCP handshake. Given the length constraints imposed by TCP options, unlike stateless resumption
mechanisms (such as that provided by session tickets in TLS) resumption in tcpcrypt requires the maintenance
of state on the server, and so successful resumption across a pool of servers implies shared state.

Owing to middlebox ossification issues, tcpcrypt only protects the payload portion of a TCP packet.
It does not encrypt any header information, such as the TCP sequence number.

### Security Features

- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Record (channel) confidentiality and integrity.
- Stateful cross-connection session resumption.
- Session caching and management.
- Application authentication delegation.

### Protocol Dependencies

- TCP.
- TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (ENO).

## WireGuard

WireGuard is a layer 3 protocol designed as an alternative to IPsec {{WireGuard}}
for certain use cases. It uses UDP to encapsulate IP datagrams between peers.
Unlike most transport security protocols, which rely on PKI for peer authentication,
WireGuard authenticates peers using pre-shared public keys delivered out-of-band, each
of which is bound to one or more IP addresses.
Moreover, as a protocol suited for VPNs, WireGuard offers no extensibility, negotiation,
or cryptographic agility.

### Protocol description

WireGuard is a simple VPN protocol that binds a pre-shared public key to one or more
IP addresses. Users configure WireGuard by associating peer public keys with IP addresses.
These mappings are stored in a CryptoKey Routing Table. (See Section 2 of {{WireGuard}}
for more details and sample configurations.) These keys are used upon WireGuard packet
transmission and reception. For example, upon receipt of a Handshake Initiation message,
receivers use the static public key in their CryptoKey routing table to perform necessary
cryptographic computations.

WireGuard builds on Noise {{Noise}} for 1-RTT key exchange with identity hiding. The handshake
hides peer identities as per the SIGMA construction {{SIGMA}}. As a consequence of using Noise,
WireGuard comes with a fixed set of cryptographic algorithms:

- x25519 {{Curve25519}} and HKDF {{RFC5869}} for ECDH and key derivation.
- ChaCha20+Poly1305 {{RFC7539}} for packet authenticated encryption.
- BLAKE2s {{BLAKE2}} for hashing.

There is no cryptographic agility. If weaknesses are found in any of
these algorithms, new message types using new algorithms must be introduced.

If a WireGuard receiver is under heavy load and cannot process a packet, e.g., cannot spare CPU
cycles for expensive public key cryptographic operations, it can reply with a cookie similar
to DTLS and IKEv2. This cookie only proves IP address ownership. Any rate limiting scheme can
be applied to packets coming from non-spoofed addresses.

### Security Features

- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Peer authentication (public-key and PSK).
- Mutual authentication.
- Record replay prevention (Stateful, timestamp-based).
- Connection mobility.
- DoS mitigation (cookie-based).

### Protocol Dependencies

- Datagram transport.
- Out-of-band key distribution and management.

## CurveCP

CurveCP {{CurveCP}} is a UDP-based transport security protocol from Daniel J. Bernstein.
Unlike other transport security protocols, it is based entirely upon highly efficient public
key algorithms. This removes many pitfalls associated with nonce reuse and key synchronization.

### Protocol Description

CurveCP is a UDP-based transport security protocol. It is built on three principal features: exclusive
use of public key authenticated encryption of packets, server-chosen cookies to prohibit memory
and computation DoS at the server, and connection mobility with a client-chosen ephemeral identifier.

There are two rounds in CurveCP. In the first round, the client sends its first initialization
packet to the server, carrying its (possibly fresh) ephemeral public key C', with zero-padding
encrypted under the server's long-term public key. The server replies with a cookie and its own ephemeral
key S' and a cookie that is to be used by the client. Upon receipt, the client then generates
its second initialization packet carrying: the ephemeral key C', the cookie, and an encryption of C',
the server's domain name, and, optionally, some message data. The server verifies the cookie
and the encrypted payload and, if valid, proceeds to send data in return. At this point, the
connection is established and the two parties can communicate.

The use of public-key encryption and authentication, or "boxing", simplifies problems that come
with symmetric key management and nonce synchronization. For example, it allows the sender
of a message to be in complete control of each message's nonce. It does not require either end
to share secret keying material. Furthermore, it allows connections (or sessions) to be associated
with unique ephemeral public keys as a mechanism for enabling forward secrecy given the risk of
long-term private key compromise.

The client and server do not perform a standard key exchange. Instead, in the initial exchange of
packets, each party provides its own ephemeral key to the other end. The client can choose a new
ephemeral key for every new connection. However, the server must rotate these keys on a slower
basis. Otherwise, it would be trivial for an attacker to force the server to create and store
ephemeral keys with a fake client initialization packet.

Servers use cookies for source validation. After receiving a client's initial packet,
encrypted under the server's long-term public key, a server generates and returns a stateless cookie
that must be echoed back in the client's following message. This cookie is encrypted under the client's
ephemeral public key. This stateless technique prevents attackers from hijacking client initialization
packets to obtain cookie values to flood clients. (A client would detect the duplicate cookies and reject
the flooded packets.) Similarly, replaying the client's second packet, carrying the cookie, will be
detected by the server.

CurveCP supports client authentication by allowing clients to send their long-term public keys in
the second initialization packet. A server can verify this public key and, if untrusted, drop the
connection and subsequent data.

Unlike some other protocols, CurveCP data packets leave only the ephemeral public key,
connection ID, and per-message nonce in the clear. All other data is encrypted.

### Protocol Features

- Datagram confidentiality and integrity (via public key encryption).
- Peer authentication (public-key).
- Unilateral responder authentication.
- Mutual authentication.
- Connection mobility (based on a client-chosen ephemeral identifier).
- Optional length-hiding and anti-amplification padding.
- Source validation (cookie-based)

### Protocol Dependencies

- An unreliable transport protocol such as UDP.

## MinimalT

MinimalT is a UDP-based transport security protocol designed to offer confidentiality,
mutual authentication, DoS prevention, and connection mobility {{MinimalT}}. One major
goal of the protocol is to leverage existing protocols to obtain server-side configuration
information used to more quickly bootstrap a connection. MinimalT uses a variant of TCP's
congestion control algorithm.

### Protocol Description

MinimalT is a secure transport protocol built on top of a widespread directory service.
Clients and servers interact with local directory services to (a) resolve server information
and (b) publish ephemeral state information, respectively. Clients connect to a local
resolver once at boot time. Through this resolver they recover the IP address(es) and
public key(s) of each server to which they want to connect.

Connections are instances of user-authenticated, mobile sessions between two endpoints.
Connections run within tunnels between hosts. A tunnel is a server-authenticated container
that multiplexes multiple connections between the same hosts. All connections in a tunnel share the
same transport state machine and encryption. Each tunnel has a dedicated control connection
used to configure and manage the tunnel over time. Moreover, since tunnels are independent of
the network address information, they may be reused as both ends of the tunnel move about the network.
This does however imply that connection establishment and packet encryption mechanisms are coupled.

Before a client connects to a remote service, it must first establish a tunnel to the host
providing or offering the service. Tunnels are established in 1-RTT using an ephemeral key
obtained from the directory service. Tunnel initiators provide their own ephemeral key and, optionally, a
DoS puzzle solution such that the recipient (server) can verify the authenticity of the
request and derive a shared secret. Within a tunnel, new connections to services may be established.

Additional (orthogonal) transport features include: connection multiplexing between hosts across
shared tunnels, and congestion control state is shared across connections between the same host pairs.

### Protocol Features

- Record or datagram confidentiality and integrity.
- Forward-secure session key establishment.
- Peer authentication (public-key).
- Unilateral responder authentication.
- DoS mitigation (puzzle-based).
- Out-of-order receipt record.
- Connection mobility (based on tunnel identifiers).

### Protocol Dependencies

- An unreliable transport protocol such as UDP.
- A DNS-like resolution service to obtain location information (an IP address) and ephemeral keys.
- A PKI trust store for certificate validation.

## OpenVPN

OpenVPN {{OpenVPN}} is a commonly used protocol designed as an alternative to
IPsec. A major goal of this protocol is to provide a VPN that is simple to
configure and works over a variety of transports. OpenVPN encapsulates either
IP packets or Ethernet frames within a secure tunnel and can run over UDP or
TCP.

### Protocol Description

OpenVPN facilitates authentication using either a pre-shared static key or
using X.509 certificates and TLS. In pre-shared key mode, OpenVPN derives
keys for encryption and authentication directly from one or multiple symmetric
keys. In TLS mode, OpenVPN encapsulates a TLS handshake, in which both peers
must present a certificate for authentication. After the handshake, both sides
contribute random source material to derive keys for encryption and
authentication using the TLS pseudo random function (PRF). OpenVPN provides the
possibility to authenticate and encrypt the TLS handshake itself using a
pre-shared key or passphrase. Furthermore, it supports rekeying using TLS.

After authentication and key exchange, OpenVPN encrypts payload data, i.e., IP
packets or Ethernet frames, and authenticates the payload using HMAC.
Applications can select an arbitrary encryption algorithm (cipher) and key
size, as well hash function for HMAC. The default cipher and hash functions
are AES-GCM and SHA1, respectively. Recent versions of the protocol support
cipher negotiation.

OpenVPN can run over TCP or UDP. When running over UDP, OpenVPN provides a
simple reliability layer for control packets such as the TLS handshake and key
exchange. It assigns sequence numbers to packets, acknowledges packets it
receives, and retransmits packets it deems lost. Similar to DTLS, this
reliability layer is not used for data packets, which prevents the problem of
two reliability mechanisms being encapsulated within each other. When running
over TCP, OpenVPN includes the packet length in the header, which allows the
peer to deframe the TCP stream into messages.

For replay protection, OpenVPN assigns an identifier to each outgoing packet,
which is unique for the packet and the currently used key. In pre-shared key
mode or with a CFB or OFB mode cipher, OpenVPN combines a timestamp with an
incrementing sequence number into a 64-bit identifier. In TLS mode with CBC
cipher mode, OpenVPN omits the timestamp, so identifiers are only 32-bit. This
is sufficient since OpenVPN can guarantee the uniqueness of this identifier for
each key, as it can trigger rekeying if needed.

OpenVPN supports connection mobility by allowing a peer to change its IP
address during an ongoing session. When configured accordingly, a host will
accept authenticated packets for a session from any IP address.


### Protocol Features

- Peer authentication using certificates or pre-shared key.
- Mandatory mutual authentication.
- Connection mobility.
- Out-of-order record receipt.
- Length-hiding padding.

See also the properties of TLS.

### Protocol Dependencies

- For control packets such as handshake and key exchange: Reliable, in-order transport. Reliability is provided either by TCP, or by OpenVPN's own reliability layer when using UDP.

# Security Features and Application Dependencies

There exists a common set of features shared across the transport protocols surveyed in this document.
Mandatory features constitute a baseline of functionality that an application may assume for any TAPS
implementation. They were selected on the basis that they are either (a) required for any secure
transport protocol or (b) nearly ubiquitous amongst common secure transport protocols.

Optional features by contrast may vary from implementation to implementation, and so
an application cannot simply assume they are available. Applications learn of and use optional features by
querying for their presence and support. Optional features may not be implemented, or may be disabled if
their presence impacts transport services or if a necessary transport service or application dependency
is unavailable.

In this context, an application dependency is an aspect of the security feature which can be exposed
to the application. An application dependency may be required for the security feature to function,
or it may provide additional information and control to the application. For example, an application
may need to provide information such as keying material or authentication credentials, or it may want
to restrict which cryptographic algorithms to allow for negotiation.

## Mandatory Features

Mandatory features must be supported regardless of transport and application services available. Note that not
all mandatory features are provided by each surveyed protocol above. For example, tcpcrypt does not provide
responder authentication and CurveCP does not provide forward-secure session key establishment.

# Transport Security Protocol Interfaces

This section describes the interface surface exposed by the security protocols described above.
Note that not all protocols support each interface. We partition these interfaces into
pre-connection (configuration), connection, and post-connection interfaces, following
conventions in {{!I-D.ietf-taps-interface}} and {{!I-D.ietf-taps-arch}}.

## Pre-Connection Interfaces

Configuration interfaces are used to configure the security protocols before a
handshake begins or the keys are negotiated.

- Identities and Private Keys

The application can provide its identities (certificates) and private keys, or
mechanisms to access these, to the security protocol to use during handshakes.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC + TLS, MinimalT, CurveCP, IKEv2, WireGuard, SRTP

- Supported Algorithms (Key Exchange, Signatures, and Ciphersuites)

The application can choose the algorithms that are supported for key exchange,
signatures, and ciphersuites.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC + TLS, MinimalT, tcpcrypt, IKEv2, SRTP

- Extensions (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation)

The application enables or configures extensions that are to be negotiated by
the security protocol, such as ALPN {{RFC7301}}.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC + TLS

- Session Cache Management

The application provides the ability to save and retrieve session state (such as tickets,
keying material, and server parameters) that may be used to resume the security session.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC + TLS, MinimalT

- Authentication Delegation

The application provides access to a separate module that will provide authentication,
using EAP for example.

Protocols: IKEv2, SRTP

- Pre-Shared Key Import

Either the handshake protocol or the application directly can supply pre-shared keys for the
record protocol use for encryption/decryption and authentication. If the application can supply
keys directly, this is considered explicit import; if the handshake protocol traditionally
provides the keys directly, it is considered direct import; if the keys can only be shared by
the handshake, they are considered non-importable.

  - Explict import: QUIC, ESP
  - Direct import: TLS, DTLS, MinimalT, tcpcrypt, WireGuard
  - Non-importable: CurveCP

## Connection Interfaces

- Identity Validation

During a handshake, the security protocol will conduct identity validation of the peer.
This can call into the application to offload validation.

Protocols: All (TLS, DTLS, QUIC + TLS, MinimalT, CurveCP, IKEv2, WireGuard, SRTP (DTLS))

- Source Address Validation

The handshake protocol may delegate validation of the remote peer that has sent
data to the transport protocol or application. This involves sending a cookie
exchange to avoid DoS attacks.

Protocols: QUIC + TLS, DTLS, WireGuard

## Post-Connection Interfaces

- Connection Termination

The security protocol may be instructed to tear down its connection and session information.
This is needed by some protocols to prevent application data truncation attacks.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC, tcpcrypt, IKEv2, MinimalT

- Key Update

The handshake protocol may be instructed to update its keying material, either
by the application directly or by the record protocol sending a key expiration event.

Protocols: TLS, DTLS, QUIC, tcpcrypt, IKEv2, MinimalT

- Pre-Shared Key Export

The handshake protocol will generate one or more keys to be used for record encryption/decryption and authentication.
These may be explicitly exportable to the application, traditionally limited to direct export to the record protocol,
or inherently non-exportable because the keys must be used directly in conjunction with the record protocol.

  - Explicit export: TLS (for QUIC), tcpcrypt, IKEv2, DTLS (for SRTP)
  - Direct export: TLS, DTLS, MinimalT
  - Non-exportable: CurveCP

- Key Expiration

The record protocol can signal that its keys are expiring due to reaching a time-based deadline, or a use-based
deadline (number of bytes that have been encrypted with the key). This interaction is often limited to signaling
between the record layer and the handshake layer.

Protocols: ESP ((Editor's note: One may consider TLS/DTLS to also have this interface))

- Mobility Events

The record protocol can be signaled that it is being migrated to another transport or interface due to
connection mobility, which may reset address and state validation and induce state changes such
as use of a new Connection Identifier (CID).

Protocols: QUIC, MinimalT, CurveCP, ESP, WireGuard (roaming)

# IANA Considerations

This document has no request to IANA.

# Security Considerations

This document summarizes existing transport security protocols and their interfaces.
It does not propose changes to or recommend usage of reference protocols. Moreover,
no claims of security and privacy properties beyond those guaranteed by the protocols
discussed are made. For example, metadata leakage via timing side channels and traffic
analysis may compromise any protocol discussed in this survey. Applications using
Security Interfaces SHOULD take such limitations into consideration when using a particular
protocol implementation.

# Privacy Considerations

Analysis of how features improve or degrade privacy is intentionally omitted from this survey.
All security protocols surveyed generally improve privacy by reducing information leakage via
encryption. However, varying amounts of metadata remain in the clear across each
protocol. For example, client and server certificates are sent in cleartext in TLS
1.2 {{RFC5246}}, whereas they are encrypted in TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}. A survey of privacy
features, or lack thereof, for various security protocols could be addressed in a
separate document.
